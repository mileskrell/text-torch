Text Torch analyzes your SMS and MMS messages and tells you how you compare to each person you message in several ways:
• what percent of the time each of you starts conversations with the other
• what percent of the texts each of you has sent
• how the average length of your texts compares to theirs

Sentry is used (opt-in) for analytics and crash reporting.

Permissions:
• READ_SMS to get SMS and MMS message data
• READ_CONTACTS to display contacts' names
• INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE for Sentry
